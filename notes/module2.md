# Module 2 - Getting started with Windows containers

Windows 10 introduces windows containerisation. 

Currently no ui

Switch to windows containers... = not executing against the docker desktop linux VM

User mode vs container user mode

Containers in windows now have containers and resource isolation. Told how much resource they can use, see it's own filesystem etc. 

Windows also brings hyper v containers. 

- Hybrid between vm and container. 

- containers don't share kernel. 

  Also enables Linux containers on windows

  - This means that you can have docker containers running on windows and linux simultaneously



Avoiding downloading large files in CI pipeline - Azure devops task Cache task. Caches everything inside a specific folder.

When using windows containers, need to make sure you are on the correct version of windows to correspond with the windows container
